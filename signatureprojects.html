                                protecting the environment will often use the terms
                                preservation and conservation. Conservation of
                                environment simply implies the sustainable use as well
                                as management of natural resources which include
                                wildlife, water, air, and earth deposits. There are
                                renewable and non-renewable natural resources.
                                Conservation of natural resources generally focuses on
                                the needs & interests of human beings, for the
                                biological, economic cultural and recreational values.
                                As far as preservation of environment is concerned, it tries to maintain the present
                                condition areas of the nature or Earth which are not yet touched by humans. This is
                                because of the fact that mankind is encroaching onto the environment at such a rate that
                                various wild landscapes are being given over to farming, industry, housing, tourism and
                                other human developments.</p>

                                <p>Blood can be defined as the fluid we have in our bodies that
                                carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. It also
                                carries waste to be eliminated from the body. It is the life of an
                                individual. We have between 4 and 6 litres of blood in our adult
                                bodies depending on size. Millions of people will need blood this
                                year.
                                There are tens of thousands of pints of blood that are needed every
                                day to help people. Some of the reasons people need blood
                                transfusions are : Surgery, accidents, Cancer, Sickle Cell and
                                Premature birth. Almost all serious health issues use blood donated by people likes you and me to save lives.
                                Blood that is donated lasts a little more than 40 days. Then it must be disposed of That means we need to
                                constantly replenish the blood so it's there when someone needs it. This blood could save a baby, a child, a
                                mother, a father, a grandfather, a grandmother. Not everyone can save a life. But you have an opportunity to.
                                Don't waste it. If you are a healthy donor, and do not mind taking a little time out of your daily schedule to
                                donate blood when someone is in an emergency, please REGISTER. you might able to save a life or help
                                ease the trauma for the kind of a patient. What's more, this very service might help you when in time of
                                need.
                                The approach is multi-pronged. Indian Blood Donors will serve as a public directory of voluntary donors.
                                The service allows those in need of blood to mention their needs which are then made visible to a wide
                                audience. A comprehensive database will help individuals locate the nearest Blood Bank</p>

                                <p>According to the World Health Report-2003, oral diseases qualify as
                                a major public health problem owing to their high prevalence and
                                incidence in all regions of the world. The greatest burden of oral
                                diseases in on disadvantaged and socially marginalised population.
                                Poor oral health may have a profound effect on general health. The
                                economic impact of oral disease is also significant. Traditional
                                treatment of oral disease is costly. In developing countries, resources
                                are primarily allocated to emergency oral care and pain relief; if
                                treatment were available, the costs of dental caries in children alone would exceed the total health care
                                budget for children. This committee will help and advice clubs to conduct dental checkup, and
                                treatment and prevention camps. School children will be taught about the tooth brushing techniques.

                                large scale, as one of the best means of social service. To
                                enable another person, obtain vision is one of the best
                                forms of charity. Even after death the donor lives in the
                                eyes of recipient. Eye from a dead person can enable two
                                blind people to acquire vision.
                                The eyes of a dead person can be used only if they are
                                taken out within 6 hrs. of death. When a person who has given consent for the donation of one's
                                eyes dies, the eye should be kept wet by sprinkling water on them. Otherwise pieces of cotton
                                wool soaked in water should be placed on both the eyes so that the cornea does not become dry till
                                the eye-surgeon arrives. After the removal of the eyes the eyelids will be stitched together and
                                there will be no visible sign of the eyes having been removed. The entire process is completed
                                within 10-15 mins. therefore if one pledged to donate his eyes after death, is the duty of his
                                relatives to inform to the nearest eye bank after his death.</p>

                                <p>Diabetes is a chronic condition associated with abnormally high levels of sugar (glucose) in the
                                blood. Insulin produced by the pancreas lowers blood glucose. Absence of insufficient production
                                of insulin, or an inability of the body to properly use insulin causes diabetes.
                                The two types of diabetes are referred to as type 1 and type 2. Former names for these conditions
                                were insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes, or juvenile onset and adult onset
                                diabetes.
                                Symptoms of diabetes include
                                • increased urine output
                                excessive thirst
                                • weight loss
                                hunger
                                • fatigue
                                skin problems
                                • slow healing wounds
                                yeast infections
                                • blurred vision, and
                                tingling or numbness in the feet or toes.
                                Chronic complications : disease of the blood vessels (both small and large) that can damage

                                Ensuring that people with a disability have maximum quality of

                                all of us, but that their dignity and social well-being should not
                                be downgraded just because of a disability. Disabilities can
                                occur through illness, aging, accidents and injuries and a wide

                                easier, doing daily tasks more comfortable and successful.

                                are forced by their children to leave their homes.
                                With no place to go and all hopes lost, the elderly
                                have to resort to old age homes, which do not
                                guarantee first class treatment. There are times when
                                parents just want to relax and want their children to
                                reciprocate their care. Every parent wants to see their
                                child grow and be successful but no parent wants
                                their child to treat them like an unnecessary load on their responsibilities.
                                Every other day, we see news of parents being beaten up by their children, parents and in-laws
                                being forced to do the household chores, being made to live in small dungeon-like rooms, their
                                property being forcefully taken over by over ambitious children. According to an estimate, nearly
                                40% of senior citizens living with their families are reportedly facing abuse of one kind or another,
                                but only 1 in 6 cases actually comes to light.</p>

                                <p>Rotary Youth Leadership Awards (RYLA) is an intensive training program that brings together youth and young
                                adults, age 14-30, to further develop character and leadership skill and learn about Rotary. RYLAs often take the
                                form of a seminar, camp, or workshop, generally 3-10 days in length, organized by Rotarians at the club, district,
                                or multi-district level.
                                Participants are nominated by local Rotary clubs, which often cover all expenses. For these young adults, this
                                recognition offers the opportunity to build self-confidence, gain exposure to a variety of issues and people, meet
                                active community leaders, and learn valuable information and RYLA gives Rotarians the opportunity to mentor
                                promising young leaders serving their own to communities and beyond. Rotarians serve as resources for
                                participants on the path to becoming professional and community leaders. In turn, RYLA can bring new energy to
                                a Rotary district, inspire ideas for service, increase support of community service projects and develop future
                                Rotarians.
                                Originating in 1959 in Queensland, Australia, RYLA was created as a festival highlighting local youth organized
                                in honor of a royal visit by Princess Victoria. Through Rotarians' constant belief in the potential of youth, RYLA
                                has since become an opportunity to help the next generation of leaders define themselves and expand their skills.
                                Officially adopted by Rotary International (RI) in 1971, this exciting program engages Rotary club and districts
                                around Each RYLA shares the following program objectives;
                                • To demonstrate Rotary's respect and concern for youth. • To encourage and assist young people in responsible
                                and effective voluntary youth leadership by providing them with a valuable training experience. • To foster
                                continued and stronger leadership of youth by youth • To publicly recognize the many young people who are
                                rendering service to their communities as youth leaders.</p>
